# 2048 Game in C++

This is a simple implementation of the classic 2048 game in C++! The game features a 4x4 grid where the player merges like-numbered tiles to form larger numbers, aiming to reach the 2048 tile.

## How to Play

- Use the following keys to make moves:
  - **W**: Move tiles up
  - **A**: Move tiles left
  - **S**: Move tiles down
  - **D**: Move tiles right
  - **Q**: Quit the game

The objective is to combine tiles with the same number to form larger numbers, with the ultimate goal of creating a tile with the number 2048.

## Features

- Simple text-based interface
- Real-time tile movement and merging
- Random placement of tiles (2 or 4)
- Game over detection when no more moves are possible
- Clear grid after each move
